This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

This project allow users to view all the publish events, and users can use the filter to find particular events. 

Core functions:
- file-based routing
- local data fetching
- realtime data fetching
- server/client data fetching
- static page generation
- server-side page generation

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

## Versions

For version 1, all the data is fetched from the local mockData file. Because the version 1 is for exploring the routing capability of NextJS.

For version 2, the data is fetched from the firebase realtime database. And the pages are static generated or server-side generated.

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.
